# Countdown Timer

## Description

This project involves creating a command-line or GUI application that counts down from a specified time. The user should be able to set the duration of the countdown (in seconds, minutes, or hours) and see the remaining time update in real-time.

## Concepts Covered

- Time manipulation (using the `time` module)
- Basic input/output
- Looping and conditional statements
- (For GUI versions) Basic GUI programming (e.g., using `tkinter`, `PyQt`, or `Kivy`)

## Potential Modules

- `time` (for time-related functions like `sleep`)
- `argparse` (optional, for command-line argument parsing)
- `tkinter`, `PyQt`, or `Kivy` (for GUI, if desired)

## Example Usage (Command-Line)

```bash
python countdown_timer.py -t 60  # Countdown for 60 seconds
python countdown_timer.py -m 5   # Countdown for 5 minutes
python countdown_timer.py -h 1   # Countdown for 1 hour
```

## Steps (Command-Line)

- **Argument Parsing (Optional):**
  - Use `argparse` to handle command-line arguments for specifying the countdown duration.
- **Input:**
  - If not using `argparse`, prompt the user to enter the countdown duration (in seconds, minutes, or hours).
- **Time Calculation:**
  - Calculate the total countdown time in seconds.
- **Countdown Loop:**
  - Use a loop to decrement the remaining time.
  - **Inside the loop:**
    - Display the remaining time in a user-friendly format (e.g., "Minutes:Seconds").
    - Use `time.sleep(1)` to pause for one second.
- **Completion Message:**
  - After the loop finishes, display a message indicating that the countdown is complete.

## Steps (GUI)

- **GUI Setup:**
  - Create a basic GUI window with labels to display the remaining time and potentially buttons to start, pause, and reset the timer.
- **Input:**
  - Use entry fields or spinboxes to allow the user to specify the countdown duration.
- **Time Calculation:**
  - Calculate the total countdown time in seconds.
- **Countdown Function:**
  - Create a function that:
    - Decrements the remaining time.
    - Updates the GUI labels.
    - Uses `time.sleep(1)` to pause.
    - Calls itself after a delay (using `after` in `tkinter`, for example) until the countdown reaches zero.
- **Button Actions:**
  - Implement actions for the start, pause, and reset buttons.
- **Completion Message:**
  - Display a message or change the GUI to indicate that the countdown is complete.

## Future Improvements

- **More Flexible Time Input:** Allow users to enter time in various formats (e.g., "1h 30m 15s").
- **Audio/Visual Alerts:** Play a sound or display a visual cue when the countdown finishes.
- **Pause/Resume Functionality:** Add the ability to pause and resume the countdown.
- **Multiple Timers:** Allow users to run multiple timers simultaneously.
- **Configurable Appearance (GUI):** Allow users to customize the GUI's appearance.
