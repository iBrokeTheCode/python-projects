# Text File Analysis Tool

## Description

This project involves creating a command-line tool that analyzes a given text file and provides various statistics. The tool will be designed to be user-friendly and efficient, offering insights into the content of the text file.

## Features

- **Word Count:** Display the total number of words in the file.
- **Line Count:** Display the total number of lines in the file.
- **Character Count:** Display the total number of characters in the file.
- **Most Frequent Words:** Display the top N most frequent words and their counts.
- **Optional Filtering:** Allow users to ignore specific words or characters.
- **Command-Line Interface:** Use argparse to create a user-friendly command-line interface.

## Concepts Covered

- **File Handling:** Reading and processing text files.
- **String Manipulation:** Cleaning and processing text data.
- **Data Structures:** Using dictionaries and lists to store and manipulate data.
- **Collections Module:** Using Counter to count word frequencies.
- **Command-Line Arguments:** Using argparse to handle user input.
- **Error Handling:** Handling potential errors, such as file not found.
- **ANSI escape code:** Applying colors to foreground and background. [source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code)

## Potential Modules

- `argparse`: For parsing command-line arguments.
- `collections`: For using `Counter` to count word frequencies.
- `os` or `pathlib`: For file existence checks.
- `re`: For more advanced text cleaning (optional).

## Example Usage

```shell
python text_analyzer.py my_file.txt --words 10
```

This command would analyze `my_file.txt`, display the top 10 most frequent words, and ignore the words "the," "a," and "an."

## Steps

- **Set up the Project:** Create a new directory for the project and create the necessary files.
- **Read the Text File:** Implement a function to read the contents of the text file.
- **Clean the Text:** Implement functions to clean the text data (e.g., remove punctuation, convert to lowercase).
- **Calculate Statistics:** Implement functions to calculate word count, line count, character count, and word frequencies.
- **Implement Command-Line Arguments:** Use `argparse` to handle user input.
- **Display Results:** Display the calculated statistics in a user-friendly format.
- **Test and Refactor:** Test your code and refactor as needed.

## Enhancements

- Add support for different output formats (e.g., CSV, JSON).
- Implement more advanced text analysis features (e.g., sentiment analysis, part-of-speech tagging).
- Create a GUI for the tool (using Tkinter or PyQt).
